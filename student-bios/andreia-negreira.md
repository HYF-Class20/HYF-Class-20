# Hi stranger! 

My name is **Andreia**, and I am excited to introduce myself. I am 29 yo and I have a bachelor in Environmental Engineer and a Msc. in Chemical and Biochemical Process Engineering, with a background in water and wastewater treatment. 

As someone who is passionate about painting, yoga and being a mom, I also enjoy coding, which sice January 24th has been my daily activity.

During my master, I have developed an interest for statistics, which has taught me the value of logic. This has also helped me develop skills in data analysis, analytical and problem-solving mindset. I believe that these skills can be applied to write good lines of code, as it requires a logical thought in order to create an eficient script. With my background and daily effort in studying what I am driven to, I am confident in my ability to work with programming in the near future. 
Whether you need help with your assignments or simply want to chat, I am here to help :blush:

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me :yellow_heart: 
I look forward to getting to know you as well!
