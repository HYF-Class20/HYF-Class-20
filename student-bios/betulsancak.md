# My bio Betul

Hi everyone, my name is Betul and I'm from Turkey. I'm really excited to be here
in this developer course! I've always been interested in technology and how it
can make our lives easier. I don't have any experience in programming. I'm
looking forward to learning more and working with all of you!
